              <p>
                Born from a deep fascination with the interplay between emotion and form, my artistic journey 
                began over two decades ago. I explore the boundaries between representation and abstraction, 
                creating works that speak to the universal human experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                My paintings are investigations into color, texture, and movementâ€”each piece a conversation 
                between conscious intention and intuitive expression. I work primarily with oils and mixed media, 
                allowing the materials themselves to guide the creative process.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based in my studio, I continue to push the boundaries of contemporary painting, 
                seeking to create work that resonates on both intellectual and emotional levels. 
                My paintings have been exhibited in galleries across the country and are held in private collections worldwide.
